## change_template_based_on_product_type.py
Simply define a mapping from product type to template, and then you can run this script to update your products accordingly.  This is helpful given that, as of July 2018, it is not possible to specify the template for products when uploading them via a `.csv` file.

## delete_products.py
Use this script to delete all of the products in your store (can be modified easily to delete only products with certain attributes).
